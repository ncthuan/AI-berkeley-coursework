### Q1 Reflex Agent
I consider a number of features of the next state: number of food eaten, distance to the closest food, capsule(power pellet), normal ghost, scared(vulnerable) ghost.<br>
Then I specify reasonable weights for each of those features.<br>
And that's pretty much it, the evaluation score is calculated by a sum of weighted features.

### Q2 Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, Expectimax
* Programmed according to the pseudocode
* Handle multi MIN agents:


### Q5 Better evaluation function
**Reuse:** 
Since the evaluation function from Q1 is already pretty good, I could easily reuse it with some slight modification in weights<br>
